# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the **DSA Repository**! This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, solutions, and explanations that I'm working through as part of my learning journey. This repo is designed to help me and others improve problem-solving skills in DSA, a fundamental part of computer science and technical interviews.

## Introduction

This repository includes a wide variety of problems related to DSA, including:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Recursion
- Tree (coming soon)
- Graph (coming soon)

Each topic folder contains solutions to various problems, along with a detailed explanation of the approach and time complexity where applicable. This collection is continuously being updated as I work through more problems.

## Topics Covered

### Arrays
Problems related to arrays, including sorting, searching, and manipulation techniques.

### Linked Lists
Includes single, double, and circular linked list operations and various problem-solving techniques.

### Stacks
Stack-related problems, focusing on Last In, First Out (LIFO) operations.

### Queues
Problems based on the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle and its variations.

### Recursion
Various problems demonstrating the power of recursion, along with explanations of how recursive calls work.

### Trees (Coming Soon)
I plan to add questions related to trees, including binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal techniques.

### Graphs (Coming Soon)
Graph-related problems will be added, covering graph traversal algorithms like BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms.

## Structure

Each topic is organized into folders. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- Solutions to the problems in various programming languages (mostly in C).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaurya01836/DSA.git

Future Updates
I will continue updating this repository with more DSA problems and solutions, particularly in the areas of:

Trees
Graphs
Advanced algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy algorithms)
